CEC
===

The R Package CEC performs clustering based on the crossâ€“entropy clustering (CEC) method, which was recently developed with the use of information theory. The main advantage of CEC is that it combines the speed and simplicity of k-means with the ability to use various Gaussian mixture models and reduce unnecessary clusters.
