CEC
===

The R Package CEC performs clustering based on the crossâ€“entropy clustering (CEC) method, which was recently developed with the use of information theory. The main advantage of CEC is that it automatically reduces unnecessary clusters while combining the speed and simplicity of k-means with the ability to easily use various gaussian mixture models.
